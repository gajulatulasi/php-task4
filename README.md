Task 4: Security Enhancements, Form Validation, and User Roles

Objective:
Enhance the applicationâ€™s security and reliability by implementing prepared statements, form validation, and role-based access control.

Implemented Features:

Prepared Statements (PDO/MySQLi)

All database queries now use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.

Ensures safer and more reliable database operations.

Form Validation

Server-side validation: Ensures data integrity and prevents malicious inputs.

Client-side validation: Provides instant feedback to users, improving user experience.

User Roles and Permissions

Extended the users table to include roles (e.g., Admin, Editor, User).

Implemented role-based access control to restrict access to specific parts of the application based on user roles.

Outcome:
The application is now more secure, robust, and user-friendly, with proper access control and validation in place.

Security Measures Documented:

Use of prepared statements

Input validation rules

Role-based access restrictions
